# SettlementFault_slipratecalc
Displacement time plots for estimating the slip rate of the Settlement Fault

Repository contains two files: 
1) slip_rate_evolution.m: creates displacement and time path histories for the Settlement Fault. Stores in MATLAB variable 'slip_rate_results.'
   
2) slip_rate_evolution_plots: uses stairs function in MATLAB to plot time-displacement histories stored in variable 'slip_rate_results . Use to reproduce Figure 11 and S8 in Williams et al. (in prep). Can also use to perform stastical analysis of the simulated time-displacement sequences (e.g. median and interquartile range, slip rate variability)
